But this is also a matter of caste and mentality, but the Principal said that the Brahmin community has hacked the entire Haryana, I will see how this child will give the 12th class examination, I will make such allegations to the Deputy Commissioner of Bhiwani. Even the CM of Haryana will not be able to issue any order regarding the examination of this child. Now you can complain to me and see that the principal comes late and goes home early. Now you will understand the consequences of complaining. Your son will now complete 12th class in his life. And these words are currently proving to be true. The Principal is so degraded that she doesn't know how to interact with a senior female citizen and doesn't show any qualities of being educated. spoken with dirty words"}

Due to illegal encroachment at many places on the Panchkosi Parikrama route, narrow alleyways, drains flowing at many places on the roads and the road being extremely narrow, a stampede may occur. Similarly, during the 14 Kosi Parikrama route, devotees have to face many types of problems. After the construction of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi temple, it is extremely necessary to speed up the process of widening of the road due to the traffic of lakhs of devotees in Ayodhya every day. Otherwise, the challenges for the Ayodhya government administration in Ayodhya are going to be huge in the coming times. Therefore, Ayodhya administration should be immediately directed to take important steps towards immediate widening of Panch Kosi and 14 Kosi Parikrama Marg. Thanks Abhay Singh Ayodhya"}

I wish I had such a powerful power that I would have the power to correct my daughter's mistake.

Almost most of the government lands of Mavai Thakuran are in the possession of land mafias, and for more than 2 years, Gata number 132,122,128,131 were in the eyes of land mafias and despite all our complaints, finally the land mafias got success. Sir, out of these, Gata numbers 122 and 131 are manure pits and 128 are in the possession of land mafia and the administration has already forcefully snatched 132 from us and given it to our party, in this regard we have made several statements on PG portal and Chief Minister's public hearing portal. Complaints were made repeatedly but construction of land plots continued on this land. Sir, the then SDM Sambhal Deependra Yadav and the then ADM Sambhal Kamlesh Kumar Awasthi have played a very important role in getting these lands captured and the present administration is also not showing any interest in getting these lands freed from encroachment.

If you want to suppress these miscreants with a strong hand, the medicine is the medicine. If necessary, send down the central military forces and cover them with good means so that they cannot leave their homes for the next six months. It is futile to try to give peace according to law to those who violate the law of the land. They are humanoid beasts, overbearing. I am waiting for your early steps and action now.

{"subject_content_text": "I was too disappointed to see the state of Najibabad to Kotdwar road. Kotdwar is considered as the gateway to major Garhwal region. The road full of big potholes, waiting for accidents. I saw a accident today only where a female sitting at the rear seat of the bike got balanced and fell on the road, it could have been worst if I had not applied immediate breaks of my car. It's very sad to see such roads during this time where the quality of roads have spared highly. All other states are developing a great infrastructure and i am disappointed to see the progress of the infrastructure in my Uttarakhand. If we can't develop good roads how can we expect our initial vision of forming this state. Very difficult to say if the Road is in potholes or potholes in the road. Request you to plz take immediate action and maintain the road for the safety of the public."}

If necessary, send down the central military forces and cover them with good means so that they cannot leave their homes for the next six months. It is futile to try to give peace according to law to those who violate the law of the land. They are humanoid beasts, overbearing. I am waiting for your early steps and action now.
